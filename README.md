# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on features like square footage, number of rooms, and location.

## Overview

Key tasks:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation

## Models

Tested models:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (Best model)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinayakula06/house-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook house-prediction.ipynb
   ```

## Results

Best model: **Gradient Boosting** with RMSE of **34,588.9617**.

## Future Work

- Explore deep learning
- Improve hyperparameter tuning
